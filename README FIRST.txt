This is the development branch of the next version of my Video Quicktags plugin.

The plugin is nowhere near done and is still in mockup phase. What I mean by that is that I'm just
getting it into a working state first. A proof of concept of sorts where I work out the
functionality and decide how to accomplish new features. It's an experiment of sorts.
Before releasing this plugin, much of it will be reworked/cleaned up from it's current state.
I just want to get it working before I worry about how the code looks.

Also many things are broken or simply don't work yet (the settings page for example).

As such, I do not recommend using this in a production environment. I'm only sharing this code
publicly so that fellow plugin developers can follow along in the development of this plugin
and provide feedback along the way.

Questions? Comments? Feedback? Please send them to me!
