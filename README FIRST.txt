This is the development branch of the next version of my Video Quicktags plugin.

The plugin is nowhere near done and is still in mockup phase. What I mean by that is that I'm just
getting it into a working state first. A proof of concept of sorts where I work out the
functionality and decide how to accomplish new features. It's an experiment of sorts.
Before releasing this plugin, much of it will be reworked/cleaned up from it's current state.
I just want to get it working before I worry about how the code looks.

Also many things are broken or simply don't work yet (the settings page for example).

As such, I do not recommend using this in a production environment. I'm only sharing this code
publicly so that fellow plugin developers can follow along in the development of this plugin
and provide feedback along the way.
